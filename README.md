## Technologies

This hipcamp.com clone was built with the Ruby on Rails backend framework. All of the data was stored through the PostgreSQL database, with large photos for campgrounds being uploaded and stored through Amazon AWS and S3 storage. The frontend utilizes React and Redux to create a dynamic, single-page web app which allows users to smoothly navigate throughout the site and allows for dynamic updating (creating, deleting booking).

## Features

- Users can sign up and create an account for the website, and can also log in to view their user profile
- Users can browse through a collection of listed campgrounds with different locations
- Users can create, view, and delete their own booked campgrounds
- Users can have hosted campgrounds, and bookings, and can view them in their user profile
